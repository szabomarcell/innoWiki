What's innoWiki?
-----------

This is a bunch of JavaScript that renders a wiki+googledocs style editor interface. This is what you've always needed to quickly edit shared documents at the corporate.

In the current version the pages are saved into a SharePoint list, but there will be other back-ends implemented.
